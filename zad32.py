'''This exercise is Part 3 of 3 of the Hangman exercise series.
In this exercise, we will finish building Hangman. In the game of Hangman, 
the player only has 6 incorrect guesses (head, body, 2 legs, and 2 arms) before they lose the game.
Copy your code from Parts 1 and 2 into a new file as a starting point. Now add the following features:
Only let the user guess 6 times, and tell the user how many guesses they have left.
Keep track of the letters the user guessed. If the user guesses a letter they already guessed, 
donâ€™t penalize them - let them guess again.
Optional additions:
When the player wins or loses, let them start a new game.
Rather than telling the user "You have 4 incorrect guesses left", display some picture art for the Hangman.
Your solution will be a lot cleaner if you make use of functions to help you!'''
