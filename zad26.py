'''This exercise is Part 2 of 4 of the Tic Tac Toe exercise series.
As you may have guessed, we are trying to build up to a full tic-tac-toe board. 
Today, we will simply focus on checking whether someone has WON a game of Tic Tac Toe, 
not worrying about how the moves were made.
If a game of Tic Tac Toe is represented as a list of lists, like so:
game = [[1, 2, 0],
	[2, 1, 0],
	[2, 1, 1]]
where a 0 means an empty square, a 1 means that player 1 put their token in that space, 
and a 2 means that player 2 put their token in that space.
Your task this week: given a 3 by 3 list of lists that represents a Tic Tac Toe game board, 
tell me whether anyone has won, and tell me which player won, if any. 
A Tic Tac Toe win is 3 in a row - either in a row, a column, or a diagonal. 
Donâ€™t worry about the case where TWO people have won - assume that in every board there will only be one winner.'''
